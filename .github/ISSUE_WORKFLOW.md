# GitHub Issue Workflow Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive GitHub issue workflow system implemented for the Ainux OS project.

## üéØ Overview

The issue workflow system provides:
- **Structured Issue Templates**: Pre-defined forms for different types of issues
- **Automated Labeling**: Automatic categorization and prioritization
- **Workflow Automation**: Auto-assignment, validation, and lifecycle management
- **Stale Issue Management**: Automated cleanup of inactive issues
- **Pull Request Validation**: Ensures PRs follow proper format and include required information

## üìù Issue Templates

### Available Templates

1. **Bug Report** (`bug_report.yml`)
   - For reporting bugs and technical issues
   - Includes hardware information collection
   - Auto-labeled with `bug` and `triage`

2. **Feature Request** (`feature_request.yml`)
   - For suggesting new features or enhancements
   - Categorizes by feature type and priority
   - Auto-labeled with `enhancement` and `triage`

3. **Hardware Support Request** (`hardware_support.yml`)
   - For requesting support for specific hardware
   - Collects detailed hardware specifications
   - Auto-labeled with `hardware` and `enhancement`

4. **Documentation Issue** (`documentation.yml`)
   - For reporting documentation problems
   - Covers missing, incorrect, or unclear documentation
   - Auto-labeled with `documentation` and `triage`

### Configuration

The `config.yml` file:
- Disables blank issues to enforce template usage
- Provides links to community discussion and security reporting

## üè∑Ô∏è Label System

### Automatic Labeling

The system automatically applies labels based on:
- **Issue Title Prefixes**: `[BUG]`, `[FEATURE]`, `[HARDWARE]`, `[DOCS]`
- **Content Keywords**: GPU, NPU, build, cluster, network, performance, etc.
- **Priority Indicators**: Critical, urgent, important keywords

### Label Categories

#### Type Labels
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Documentation improvements
- `duplicate` - Already exists
- `question` - Information request

#### Component Labels
- `gpu` - GPU-related issues
- `npu` - NPU-related issues
- `hardware` - Hardware support
- `build` - Build system related
- `cluster` - Cluster management
- `installation` - Installation and deployment
- `performance` - Performance improvements
- `networking` - Network-related issues
- `kernel` - Linux kernel related
- `ai-frameworks` - AI/ML framework integration

#### Priority Labels
- `priority:low` - Low priority
- `priority:medium` - Medium priority
- `priority:high` - High priority
- `priority:critical` - Critical priority

#### Status Labels

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Templates
1. Create new `.yml` file in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
2. Follow GitHub's issue form syntax
3. Update label automation in `issue-management.yml`

### Modifying Labels
